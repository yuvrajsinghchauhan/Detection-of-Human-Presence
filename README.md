# Detection-of-Human-Presence
Over the recent years, detecting human beings in a video scene of a surveillance system is attracting more attention due to its wide range of applications in abnormal event detection, human gait characterization, person counting in a dense crowd, person identification, gender classification,Â etc.

Our project aims to track the number of people present at a place and can be used in stores, restaurants, malls, etc. to get data on how many visitors enter a store and at what time. To know how many visitors actually become customers.
